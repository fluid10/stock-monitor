# Stock Monitor

Stock Monitor lets you choose stocks that interest you and places them into watchlistsâ€”categories you create to organize your stocks. As soon as you add a stock into one of your watchlists, latest available data for that stock gets fetched and is displayed. Your stock portfolio gets created using all the stocks that you picked. Individual stock data updates regularly, so your portfolio statistics get updated as well.

Inside the new *dist* folder, open *index.html* and replace line 4 with `<base href="./">`
